# Progress bar

Implement a progress bar component which shows the completion progress by filling the bar proportionately to the progress (a number between 0-100, inclusive).

## Requirements

- The filled bar can be of any color. The example uses #c5c5c5 for the background color and #0d6efd for the progress color.
- The completion % is shown in the center of the filled bar.
  A ProgressBar.js skeleton component has been created for you. You are free to decide the props of <ProgressBar />.
